# Full-Stack Challenge (CPU Usage Hours Dashboard)

This challenge is the build a simple dashboard application.

This application must:

1. Load the data (`cpu_hours.csv`) on the client from a server (REST API).

2. Visualize the data on the client as a chart.

Our preference is React/TypeScript (Client) + Django/Python (Server), but you may complete the challenge using your choice of language(s) and framework(s).

We have provided some basic scaffolding to get you started (Vite/React/TypeScript client, Django/Python server or Express/TypeScript server).

If you have extra time, consider extending the functionality of your solution. Add anything else you think would be cool :)

Have fun!

#### Some example feature extensions:

- Chart Hover Tooltips

- Chart Filters

- Chart Variants (e.g. line, bar, etc.)

- Chart View (e.g. year, month, week, etc.)

- Chart Interactions (e.g. zoom to change view)

- MySQL Database

- Authentication

## Please Provide A Write Up For Your Work

### Anything we should know about your implementation? Libraries we need to install for it to work? Commands we need to run?

Just a basic application. Just clone the project, run "npm run install" then run "npm start"

### What features did you add? How do we use these features?

- Hover to see value: Hover over any area on the chart
- Switch line chart or bar chart: click on the toggle icon to switch
- A simple to use and understand UI

### Can you walk us through your thought process for implementing this challenge? How did you approach solving it? Where did you start?

I thought, what type of chart would go best for these? I concluded on line and bar charts, and due to my previous experience working with csv files, that aspect was a breeze. I looked at it from a user perspective, and determined that freedom to choose the year and month will make it easier and smoother for both me and the end user.

### What was the most difficult part of the challenge?

To be honest, I think it should be styling the checkbox

### What do you like about your implementation?

The simplicity of the project. Using one package each on server and client file, one file, keeping everything to a minimal while achieving the aim of the website, with charts very easy to understand, and information was being passed in a nice manner

### If you had more time, what would you do next? What would you change? What would you improve?

Ability to see average usage for months of the year, adding more charts
